This is a lightweight program for Windows that will allow you to visually identify wormholes without needing to fly through it to check.



### Installation

Installation is relatively simple. Just extract all the files included in [releases](https://github.com/Gh0stReaper123/eveWhID/releases) into their own folder.



### Usage

To run the program, just run the .exe file.



### Building the source



If you wish to compile the source yourself, you'll need the following:

* [Python 3.5+](https://python.org) with the following modules

  * [cx_Freeze](https://github.com/anthony-tuininga/cx_Freeze)

  * [guizero](https://lawsie.github.io/guizero/) with the images extension

    ```pip install guizero[images] --user```

  * Tkinter (should be part of the standard python)

Once these are installed run the following in command prompt:

```python setup.py build```
